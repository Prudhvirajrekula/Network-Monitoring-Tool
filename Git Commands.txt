Important things to remember 

-DO NOT PUSH TO THE DEFAULT (main) DIRECTORY
-PUSH TO YOUR DIRECTORY AND THEN MERGE



- Three important locations here.
	-Working directory (where you save your file) 		[local machine]
	-Local repo	   (where git creates a snapshot) 	[local machine]

	-Remote repo	   (origin or github url)			[remote server]



-git clone 	=> Clones the content of the remote repo to working directory.

-git commit 	=> Copies the content of your working directory to the local repository.

	git commit -m "message" => -m adds a message feature. 

-git push	=> This uploads your local commits to the remote repository.

-git pull 	=> Copies files from remote repository to local machine. This does the job of both fetch + merge commands.

-git fetch 	=> Copies files from remote repository to local repo.

-git merge 	=> Copies files from one branch into another.

-git rebase 	=> rebase merges your current branch upstream into the main branch, permanently merging into it. (DO NOT USE THIS.)

-git switch 	=> switch between branches.

-git push origin --delete <branch-name> => deletes remote branch.
-git branch --delete <branch-name>

-git push --set-upstream origin/<branchname>  => do this so that you understand what upstream and downstream is.

-git remote remove origin


+++ If using the terminal or cmd +++

Change the path to your working directory using cd command. (change directory)

---This is the order that I followed:

>git init

>git add .

>git remote add origin https://github.com/jash218/Basic-Network-Monitoring/ 	# Paste your Url here

>git remote --v 								# Displays the origin url as a string

>git checkout -b Jash-branch  							# Creates new branch 

!!! TRIPLE CAUTION !!!

$$$ DO NOT PUSH BEFORE CHECKING WHICH BRANCH YOU ARE PUSHING TO! $$$


>git push origin Jash-branch
